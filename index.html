  <h2>JavaScript required</h2>
  <h3>JavaScript needed for webapp to function</h3>
  <h3>Too long; didn't read:</h3>
  <p>
    JavaScript is required for this webapp to work.
    Please enable it in your browser settings.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Isn't it very obvious that literally every webapp needs JavaScript to function properly? Everything is broken without it.
    I mean, I can't even load snippets without involving a single <code>fetch()</code>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScript, by itself, isn't a security threat.
    It's not going to hack your device, for real. Honestly, I don't even own a dynamic backend to store whatever in your device.
    Let alone making it work for a millisecond.
    Only those malicious websites would try to trick you into enabling JavaScript to run their malwares.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the way, do <strong>not</strong> confuse a hacker (a.k.a cybersecurity expert, cybercriminal) with programmer (a.k.a developer, coder, etc.). 
    They work in two totally unrelated realms. Like, they are literally the opposite of each other.
    I can't tell you how many times I've seen people mixing those two up. Even Hollywood movies do that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, JavaScript won't ever work unless you enable it in your browser settings.
    Outside of a browser, nothing but malwares would ever ask you for permission to run JavaScript.
    Unless you have Node.js. But that's a different story.
  </p>
  <h2>Too short; I like to read:</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>How to enable JavaScript?</summary>
    <p>
      It depends on which browser you're using.
      Generally on the only three browsers that really differ (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), 
      you can find the option in Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Site Settings &gt; JavaScript.
      Just make sure it's set to "Allowed" for this site. Maybe not for other sites unless they're not malicious.
      <br>
      If you need more specific instructions, just search "enable JavaScript in [your browser name]".
      (wait, why I need to tell you so much? I should write a book then...)
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What if I have Node.js?</summary>
    <p>
      Okay, that's the different story I talked about.
      Simply said, Node.js is a browser without the HTML and CSS.
      If you have it installed, you <em>must</em> know what you're doing.
      Then you should've enabled JavaScript already.
      So, nothing stops you from running this webapp. Expect...what???
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What if I don't like to enable JavaScript?</summary>
    <p>
      Well, that's your choice.
      But basically this webapp is a statue without JavaScript.
      Nothing admirable would even work.
      So, you might as well just close this page and do something else.
      <br>
      It's not like the app itself can force enable JavaScript anyway. It simply can't have such privilege.
    </p>
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>
        You can see the source of it at <a href="https://github.com/T6970/VVSCE">GitHub</a>.
        There's nothing malicious in it. I verified.
        <br>
        Most malwares are closed source so no one can find or inspect their code.
        That's exactly why this is open source. (Well, one of the reasons.)
      </p>
    </p>

  <details>
    <summary>What is a JavaScript?</summary>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a programming language.
      <div class="nest card">
        <h3>What's a programming language?</h3>
        Ask Google. Or whatever database (i.e. search engine, AI, AI, AI, AI) you like.
      </div>
      And this language is for webpages, for literally every logic and interaction.
      What the heck I should use if not JavaScript? C++? Java?? Go??? Rust???? Lua????? Python?????? Ruby??????? 
      They all compile to WebAssembly if you want to run them in a browser. Still, it's dependent on JS.
      <br>
      HTML and CSS aren't programming languages. They simply won't work.
